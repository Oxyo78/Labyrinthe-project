# Labyrinthe-project

This is a Python develloper Project from OpenClassrooms.com

It's a small labyrinthe game with Macgyver, you have to pick up the 3 item on map before to go the gardian exit

At this moment, I'm using the cx_freeze 6.0b1 from the official deposit on GitHub to compil in exe

You can make your own map (15*15 sprite) by modifing the map/Levelgame.txt, use upper letter:
	M for wall
	G for way character
	A for the arrival sprite(optionnal)
	P for the starting player position
	B for the gardian position

The 3 item will appear randomly on the way character

You can build with cx-freeze or try the windows build

have fun !
